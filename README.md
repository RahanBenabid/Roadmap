# Roadmap Backend Projects

This repository contains my solutions to backend challenges from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects?g=backend), primarily using Node.js with occasional use of Swift.  This is an ongoing project, and I am continuously working through the available challenges.

## Projects

Here's what I've built so far:

* **Task Tracker:** A simple command-line app for managing tasks. It uses a JSON file to store everything, letting you create, read, update, and delete tasks.
* **Expense Tracker API:**  Similar to the Task Tracker, but with more advanced features, This backend API handles expense tracking and includes user *authentication* and *authorization* using *JWT*.
* **Weather API:**  This one takes a country name and returns a bunch of weather info.  It also uses *Redis* for caching.
* **GitHub User Activity:**  Curious about what someone's been up to on GitHub? This command-line tool fetches and displays their public activity. Just enter a username and see what they've been doing.
* **Number Guessing Game:** A classic number guessing game you can play in your terminal. Choose your difficulty and dive in.
* **Unit Converter:** Unlike the other projects, this one has a UI, Convert various units like length, weight, volume, and more.
* **Blogging Platform API:** A basic API for managing blog posts. Create, read, update, and delete posts.
* **BroadCast Server:** A real-time chat application built using Express and Socket.io. Users can send and receive messages instantly in a shared chat room. The app has some clean, modern interface too.
